Version 0.3 released: 2002-01-08
	* Improved documentation
	* Added subpackages:
		- reflective, with visitors that can themselves be visited
		- graph, with visitors for graph operations
	* Removed bug in One combinator.

Version 0.2 released: 2001-11-20
	* All visitors are now _returning_ visitors, i.e. the visit method
	  now has a Visitable as return value.
	* The original, non-returning visitor is now called VoidVisitor.
	  VoidVisitor is a subtype of Visitor that adds the voidVisit
	  method, an implements the visit method in terms of it.
	* Documentation for JJTraveler is now automically generated
	  with javadoc.
	* Added many unit tests, using the JUnit testing tools.
	* Many new combinators added.


Version 0.1 released: 2001-06-28
	* The JJTraveler package contains the visitor combinator framework
          previously included in the JJForester distribution, with some
          modifications:
            - The names AnyVisitor, AnyVisitable, visit_Any, getKid,
              and numberOfKids, have been changed into Visitor, Visitable,
              visit, getChildAt, and getChildCount.
            - The method setChildAt has been added to the Visitable
              interface, and the method accept_Any has been removed.
