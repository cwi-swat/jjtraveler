    This document is the generated API specification for JJTraveler,
     version __VERSION__.
    JJTraveler is a combination of a framework and a library that
    provide generic visitor combinators for Java.

    <h3>What are visitor combinators?</h3>
    The notion of visitor combinators was first introduced in
    <em>Visitor Combination and Traversal Control</em> (Joost Visser,
    OOPSLA 2001). Visitor combinators are small, reusable classes that
    implement a <em>generic</em> visitor interface. Here, `generic' 
    means: independent of any specific class hierarchy. Each combinator
    captures a basic piece of functionality. They can be composed in 
    different constellations to build more complex visitors.

    <h3>What is JJTraveler?</h3>
    JJTraveler provides an implementation of generic visitor combinators
    for Java. JJTraveler consists of a framework and a library. The 
    framework provides some interfaces that a user must instantiate in
    order to take advantage of JJTraveler. The library contains a collection
    of predefined visitor combinators for a range of tasks.

    <h3>How do I use JJTraveler?</h3>
    To use JJTraveler, you first have to instantiate JJTraveler's
    framework for the class-hierarchy of your application. This means
    that you have to supply implementations of JJTraveler's generic
    interfaces <code>Visitable</code> and <code>Visitor</code>.
    <p>
    After instantiation of JJTraveler's framework, you can reuse the
    combinators in its library. Such reuse can take several forms. Firsly,
    you can reuse the generic combinators of the library <em>as-is</em>, 
    and apply them direcly to the objects in your application. Secondly, 
    you can <em>specialize</em> the generic combinators with behaviour 
    that is specific for some classes in your application. For those classes
    for which you do not implement specific behaviour, the generic behaviour
    of the combinators you specialize is reused. Thirdly, you can compose
    compound visitors by passing generic and specific visitors combinators
    as arguments to each other.
