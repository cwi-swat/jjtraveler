Version 0.1 released: 2001-06-28
	* The JJTraveler package contains the visitor combinator framework
          previously included in the JJForester distribution, with some
          modifications:
            - The names AnyVisitor, AnyVisitable, visit_Any, getKid,
              and numberOfKids, have been changed into Visitor, Visitable,
              visit, getChildAt, and getChildCount.
            - The method setChildAt has been added to the Visitable
              interface, and the method accept_Any has been removed.
