         * Created a separate package for JJTraveler, the visitor
	   combinator framework previously included in the JJForester
	   distribution.
	 * AnyVisitor and AnyVisitable are now called Visitor and
	   Visitable.
 	 * The accept_Any methods has been removed from Visitable since
 	   one can always call Visitor.visit_Any directly, iso via
	   accept_Any.
	 * The methods visit_Any, getKid, and numberOfKids have been
	   renamed to visit, getChildAt, and getChildCount. These names
	   are inspired by javax.swing.tree.TreeNode.
