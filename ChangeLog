	* Moved several graph-related classes from subpackage util to
	  subpackage graph.
	
2001-11-28 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Started subpackage "graph" which contains combinators for
	  operating on (non-tree) shaped graph structures.
	
2001-11-28 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Improved documentation by (i) adding package overview files, and
 	  (ii) adding method and class comments.
	* Created a reflective visitor combinator WrapLog that visits a 
	  visitor and wraps it into a LogVisitor.
	
2001-11-28 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Started subpackage "reflective" which contains classes and
	  interfaces for visiting visitors themselves.

2001-11-20 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Released version 0.2 and bumped to 0.3a.
	
2001-11-12 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Started a new subpackage "util", and added some combinators
	  for constructing graphs.
	
2001-10-24 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl 
	* Added visitor combinator Backtrack(StateVisitor), which saves
   	  the state of its argument visitor before executing it, and
 	  restores this state afterwards. Note that the argument visitor
 	  should clone its state before modifying it, otherwise state
 	  restoration will not work properly.

2001-10-24 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl, Arie.van.Deursen@cwi.nl
	* Added subpackage "test", containing unit tests for the library
	  combinators. These tests make use of a class Node of mock objects
	  that log invocations of their methods.
	* "data" subdirectories are no longer required.

2001-07-02 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
	 * "Not" combinator added.
         * Visitor fields in visitor combinators are now public, to make
	   extending them possible.

2001-06-29 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
         * Changed visitors into _returning_ visitors, i.e. the
 	   visit method now has a Visitable return value. 
	   The original, non-returning visitor is now called VoidVisitor.
 	   VoidVisitor is a subtype of Visitor that adds the voidVisit
 	   method, and implements the visit method in terms of it.
	 * Documentation for JJTraveler is now automically generated
	   with javadoc.

2001-06-28 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
         * Released version 0.1 and bumped to 0.2a.
	
2001-06-27 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
         * Added explicit constructor definitions to the class
 	   VisitFailure.
	
2001-06-06 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
         * Created a separate package for JJTraveler, the visitor
	   combinator framework previously included in the JJForester
	   distribution.
	 * AnyVisitor and AnyVisitable are now called Visitor and
	   Visitable.
 	 * The accept_Any methods has been removed from Visitable since
 	   one can always call Visitor.visit_Any directly, iso via
	   accept_Any.
	 * The methods visit_Any, getKid, and numberOfKids have been
	   renamed to visit, getChildAt, and getChildCount. These names
	   are inspired by javax.swing.tree.TreeNode.
