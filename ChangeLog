Fri Dec 17 09:16:46 CET 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 0.4.5 

Wed Apr 14 14:48:46 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi,nl>
	* Added junit.jar to distribution
	* Moved all test java files back to the source packages 
	* Removed one level of generation of configure.in scripts
	  (old-style XT style, now in Meta-Environment style)

Tue Feb 10, Arie.van.Deursen@cwi.nl
	* Added Child and Descendant combinators and corresponding
	  test cases.

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

Mon Feb  2 14:42:35 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
	* Makefile.am: add generated package file to CLEANFILES
	* .../util/test/Makefile.am: EXTRA_JAVA -> EXTRA_DIST or
	  TestAll.java doesn't get added in the distribution
	* After previous two fixes, several more came up:
	  - had to add all java_JAVA contents to EXTRA_DIST or
	    .java files won't end up in distribution.
	  - suspended installation of html (javadoc) files: these
	    were installed using a "manual" cp (rather than a proper
	    automake installation) and were never *un*installed which
	    1.6 automake doesn't like.


2004-01-30 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Bumped to 0.4.3
	* Made configure.in, reconf and Makefile.am's automake-1.6 compliant

2003-09-26 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Release 0.4.2

2003-08-05 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Separated out all JUnit tests into test directories.

2003-08-01 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Reactivated JUnit tests. If JUnit is found by the configure script,
	  then the tests are activated. If JUnit is not found, the tests
	  are deactivated and a warning message is printed.
	* Set version to 0.4.2

2003-07-31 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Removed JUnit check to make one release of the Meta-Environment
          build without the JUnit in the CLASSPATH
	* JUnit tests are disabled for the moment

2003-07-18 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Fixed some problems with the configure scripts on SunOs

2003-07-17 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Checking for JUnit in configure.in strengtened. If JUnit is not
	  found, the configure process fails with an error message. The
	  user should then at least have a "." and the path to a junit.jar
	* Set version to 0.4.1
       
2003-07-03 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Changed location of JJTraveler distribution to 
          http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/jjtraveler

2003-04-24 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Released version 0.4

2003-03-20 Jurgen.Vinju@cwi.nl
	* Added a script jjtraveler-config that prints the path to the jar file
	  that this packages builds. This script can/will be used by other 
	  packages for CLASSPATH construction.
	* Added automatic construction and installation of a jar file:
          jjtraveler-<VERSION>.jar
      
2002-02-11 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Added support to Logger for computing elapsed time.

2001-12-10 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Moved several graph-related classes from subpackage util to
	  subpackage graph.
	
2001-11-28 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Started subpackage "graph" which contains combinators for
	  operating on (non-tree) shaped graph structures.
	
2001-11-28 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Improved documentation by (i) adding package overview files, and
 	  (ii) adding method and class comments.
	* Created a reflective visitor combinator WrapLog that visits a 
	  visitor and wraps it into a LogVisitor.
	
2001-11-28 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Started subpackage "reflective" which contains classes and
	  interfaces for visiting visitors themselves.

2001-11-20 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Released version 0.2 and bumped to 0.3a.
	
2001-11-12 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl
	* Started a new subpackage "util", and added some combinators
	  for constructing graphs.
	
2001-10-24 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl 
	* Added visitor combinator Backtrack(StateVisitor), which saves
   	  the state of its argument visitor before executing it, and
 	  restores this state afterwards. Note that the argument visitor
 	  should clone its state before modifying it, otherwise state
 	  restoration will not work properly.

2001-10-24 Joost.Visser@cwi.nl, Arie.van.Deursen@cwi.nl
	* Added subpackage "test", containing unit tests for the library
	  combinators. These tests make use of a class Node of mock objects
	  that log invocations of their methods.
	* "data" subdirectories are no longer required.

2001-07-02 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
	 * "Not" combinator added.
         * Visitor fields in visitor combinators are now public, to make
	   extending them possible.

2001-06-29 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
         * Changed visitors into _returning_ visitors, i.e. the
 	   visit method now has a Visitable return value. 
	   The original, non-returning visitor is now called VoidVisitor.
 	   VoidVisitor is a subtype of Visitor that adds the voidVisit
 	   method, and implements the visit method in terms of it.
	 * Documentation for JJTraveler is now automically generated
	   with javadoc.

2001-06-28 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
         * Released version 0.1 and bumped to 0.2a.
	
2001-06-27 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
         * Added explicit constructor definitions to the class
 	   VisitFailure.
	
2001-06-06 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
         * Created a separate package for JJTraveler, the visitor
	   combinator framework previously included in the JJForester
	   distribution.
	 * AnyVisitor and AnyVisitable are now called Visitor and
	   Visitable.
 	 * The accept_Any methods has been removed from Visitable since
 	   one can always call Visitor.visit_Any directly, iso via
	   accept_Any.
	 * The methods visit_Any, getKid, and numberOfKids have been
	   renamed to visit, getChildAt, and getChildCount. These names
	   are inspired by javax.swing.tree.TreeNode.
