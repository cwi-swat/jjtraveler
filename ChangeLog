	 * "Not" combinator added.
         * Visitor fields in visitor combinators are now public, to make
	   extending them possible.

         * Changed visitors into _returning_ visitors, i.e. the
 	   visit method now has a Visitable return value. 
	   The original, non-returning visitor is now called VoidVisitor.
 	   VoidVisitor is a subtype of Visitor that adds the voidVisit
 	   method, and implements the visit method in terms of it.
	 * Documentation for JJTraveler is now automically generated
	   with javadoc.

         * Released version 0.1 and bumped to 0.2a.

         * Added explicit constructor definitions to the class
 	   VisitFailure.
	
2001-06-06 Joost Visser <Joost.Visser@cwi.nl>
         * Created a separate package for JJTraveler, the visitor
	   combinator framework previously included in the JJForester
	   distribution.
	 * AnyVisitor and AnyVisitable are now called Visitor and
	   Visitable.
 	 * The accept_Any methods has been removed from Visitable since
 	   one can always call Visitor.visit_Any directly, iso via
	   accept_Any.
	 * The methods visit_Any, getKid, and numberOfKids have been
	   renamed to visit, getChildAt, and getChildCount. These names
	   are inspired by javax.swing.tree.TreeNode.
